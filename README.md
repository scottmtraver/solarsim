# Solarsim

This project is a sample simulation of heat transfer from a solar panel to a storage tank.

## Assumptions

We are using water as a medium of both solar collection and transfer to the storage/holding tank.
Any heat loss in the transfer process (pipes) is disregarded at the moment simulating a lossless transfer as we focus only on the use of the storage tank for incrased volume for the solar collector.

## Resources

Equations adapted from [Solar Water Heater Efficiency Analysis](https://www.teachengineering.org/content/cub_/activities/cub_solarenergy/cub_solarenergy_lesson01_activity1_worksheet2_tedl_mhf.pdf)

# Angular and Code Running

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
